The main goal
Our aim is to make easier and funnier the process of learning Kazakh language. For many people, Kazakh language is considered to be the hardest one and it is a little bit confusing to visit many courses or tutors to learn it. Also, school programs sometimes seem useless. Therefore, our team has a solution for this problem. We find learning Kazakh by watching your favorite films, cartoons and TV shows in Kazakh very interesting and beneficial. Watching Kazakh content helps people to improve their listening and speaking skills.
